# Total Annihilation: Redux
This mod is based on [Switech](http://switeck.tauniverse.com/)'s [TA Bugfix mod](https://files.tauniverse.com/files/ta/mods/ta-bugfix/), and was primarily aimed at integrating automatic radar targeting as a default to TA (instead of relying on the expensive radar targeting facility), on top of the other fixes implemented by Switeck.

To install this mod, you have to download the latest release, unpack the zip archive into your TA install directory (Cavedog's original v3.1 TA from GOG.com, or the [unofficial v3.9.02 patch](https://files.tauniverse.com/files/ta/unofficial-patch/)), and execute `ta-redux_install.cmd`. To revert back to your original installation, simply execute `ta-redux_uninstall.cmd`.

The following changes were made to TA units:
* Radar towers and advanced radar towers enable automatic radar targeting. Their metal and energy costs have been increased (x4), as well as their build time (x4) and energy consumption (x12).
* The radar targeting facility now has an embedded infinite range radar, to avoid making it completely useless.
* All cloakable units now have Stealth (they don't appear on the opponent's radar), to avoid them being automatically shot when covered by radar. As a matter of fact, cloaking does not remove the unit from the opponent's radar... so making them always stealth was the only viable option.

These changes make radar towers and advanced towers key structures in your base, but the increased cost also means you won't be able to spam them. This enables new raiding strategies, such as splitting your units into an anti-radar scouts team, followed by a slower longer ranged units squad. It also increases the importance of mobile radar and jamming units later in the game, because these are now a lot cheaper than radar towers, making them priority targets for the opponent when you raid him.
